# object_tracking_based_on_colour
It involves using computer vision techniques to monitor and follow objects in
a video stream by identifying their unique color characteristics. By isolating and tracking specific colors, this method enables
real-time monitoring of objectsâ€™ movements, aiding applications like surveillance, robotics, and augmented reality.
In this project we should know the HSV upper and lower values of a colour what we are tracking for by running colorCalibration.py file
then we should mention that values in given opcv file.
